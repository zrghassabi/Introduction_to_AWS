# Introduction_to_AWS

This is an Introductory to Amazon Web Service. Nowadays, when you are applying for machine learning jobs, hiring managers ask you if you are familiar with AWS/Azure/Google cloud Platform? 

If you spend long time on research and you are not familiar with producing applications, you can follow up the following steps to learn AWS quickly as I did. 

To learn the machine learning pipiline in AWS

Even if you do not have much knowledge of machine learning, by the end of the course, you will have successfully built, trained, evaluated, tuned, and deployed an ML model using Amazon SageMaker that solves their selected business problem. 

I also recommend to take these courses to learn AWS with computer vision and machine learning.

1- creat an acount in aws.amazon.com

First, you need to create a AWS acount which requires valid email address as root acount and credit card. choose basic plan among support plans( Basic, developer, business) if you do not want to pay.

Amazon SageMaker Python SDK is one of tools for traing and deploying model.

2-To store your data, build a bucket in s3 using Amazon SageMaker in Amazon Management Console . You will push your data in the bucket and will train your model on these data

bucket has secret id and key id (our credentials)

3- Create Notebook instance , you can choose standard type if you do not want to pay. other types like accelerators will charge you.
please make sure that the status of notebook is "stoped", otherwise Amazon will charge you.

4- you can use build-in frameworks for your model or use your own code in your laptop.
