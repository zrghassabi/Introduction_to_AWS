Even if you do not have much knowledge of machine learning, by the end of the course, you will have successfully built, trained, evaluated, tuned, and deployed an ML model using Amazon SageMaker that solves their selected business problem. 

I also recommend to take these courses to learn AWS with computer vision and machine learning.
